First of all, error function depends on the user. My error definition could be different from your error definition because of the problem and how I value my errors. It is perfectly subjective. Second, we also keep in mind how we optimize or solve the problem. For example, we would like to minimize the number of misclassification. Unfortunately, that’s a bad choice from the optimization point of view. Over time what we have learnt is, for most of the problems we know what is the right objective or loss function. It is not arbitrary. You don’t have to search for many possibilities. You will know if it is a classification, this is the loss function.  For regression, other loss function. It has to change as your problem is different from others problem. Everybody cannot have the same loss.
