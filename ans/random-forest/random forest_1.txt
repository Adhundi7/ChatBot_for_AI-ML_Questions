So how did I decide how to split at the top? When a decision tree is going to be built at the root node I looked at all the data and I have to divide it into two parts, as it is the random binary split. There are different ways to do decision trees, one of the methods in the case of CART was i'll do my binary splits. So I will ask a question is one feature greater than threshold or not? It is that node, Otherwise it is this node. You split the data set into two parts and which feature should I look at to do the splitting? If I have one thousand features, I will not go over all the thousand features, I will only look at hundred features out of it.
