Denoising is directly for denoising when I have noisy data and I want to cleanup how do I do that if I 
have large example of cleaned data I will artificially introduce noise and make the network to clean and 
then later on when I get only noisy data I will send the noisy data and outputs the cleaned data. Denoising 
comes under compression in any other way in which your data get corrupted and you want to uncorrupt or
 clean it you can use it not only for images you can use it for text.
