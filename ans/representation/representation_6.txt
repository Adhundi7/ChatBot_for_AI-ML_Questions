When you write exams we believe exams have new questions coming in. If we learn the concepts well, 
you will be able to do well. If you byheart the questions and answers, you will not be able to 
answer new questions well. Our algorithms are not byhearting, we want to make sure that 
for example a decision tree, if we allow a decision tree to go deep it will byheart all the training data, 
if we don't stop decision tree it can byheart . The way this is prevented is don't go deep. 
There are many tricks to do this formally. One simplest way to do this is to keep test data 
away from training data.

Generally, we will learn how to do this formally. A major concern for us is how do you do well in unseen data. 
It is a little conceptually difficult for us to digest that we can ever do that. That is what we always learn. 
We want to learn not fact but the essence of it.
