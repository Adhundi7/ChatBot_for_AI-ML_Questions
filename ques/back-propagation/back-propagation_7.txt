Here we are initially starting with the weights and then we computing the output, as well as we have expected output also along with us. Now the difference between the computed output and the expected output is only loss. Let's consider with an example, I have only initial value as w, Now I want to have the rate of the loss with respect to w. I don't want to call numerator and denominator here. So in that case did I get the final value of w to compute the change in the value w ? Along with that I want to get dl by dw, to do that there must be two values for w right ?
