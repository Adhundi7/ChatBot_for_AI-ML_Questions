If you saw as I said, previous architecture was input and output that the horizontal loop was not there. This connection was not there. If you look carefully, this U and V are the same at each level. So, if I remove this horizontal connection, then I’m just taking the input and predicting the output of what I have done in Multi-layer Perceptron. Then weights are just this U and V. There are only two sets of weight. But I’m introducing a new weight called ‘W’ and passing some horizontal information also.
