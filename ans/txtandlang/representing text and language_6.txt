It really depends on the business problem. In some cases it is really worthwhile calibrating and any time you decide the world is changing and we have to move; two things, do you have the ability to move the model, second is if you move what are the risks? Because when you move are you moving in the right direction or a wrong direction? Because during training you had a large amount of data and you could validate all those.How is it different from traditional software? You get a new requirement you change. Do you throw away the old system and rebuilt or do you modify? Depends on how relevant old system’s construction is? You deal with change in data the same way.

Depends on how relevant old system’s construction is? You deal with change in data the same way.          On top of it, machine learning algorithms can do slightly better. You could build a machine learning algorithm that can continuously evolve if you want to, if you are brave enough to do that. But, otherwise, if you have issues in the traditional framework, whatever solutions exist would apply here also.
