In PCA we were reducing the number of dimensions based on the X(input). Suppose if we give the input dimension as three then the output is one.

If you are working with simple problems like apples and oranges linear simple classifiers will works. The moment you are move on to complex problems which you are unable to explain so there the concept of interest is extremely complex for simple classifier to characters, You need a very powerful function class. So, the linear classifier donâ€™t have enough expressive power to capture what is beautiful. So, when the concept of interest is complex, you need a complex function to represent it.In the beginning we dealt with simple algorithms like linear classifier, now we are dealing with complex algorithms like Perceptron where each layer is linear but combined it is non-linear and more complex.
