one is to make sure that you are not overfitting and another
 make sure that you are not underfitting both are bad for 
you if you look at the validation curve it looks like that 
validation accuracy to be high validation error to be low. 
If your model is too complex your validation error is too 
high or if you train too much the error rate is high your
 training curve always goes down but the validation curve 
is always same if you have more number of features you 
will end up with complex ones so you wanted to throw 
unwanted features if you have few good features it will
 perform well but you donâ€™t know how to extract those 
features what do I do is I will throw away these features
 let the machine learning algorithm figure out what are the 
features. I will throw all the data and I will ask machine 
learning model to reduce the features and then try it 
out. Hopefully it will figure out what are few features 
that are perfect for it. If we ask the generic problem
 finally you tell it depends on the data that you 
will take.
