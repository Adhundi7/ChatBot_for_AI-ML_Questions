The general design guidelines people have realized 
is that small filter size is good enough to get large 
receptive fields but they also have added advantage 
that the number of weights come down and it learns 
better. One successful story for the deep nets is the 
sketch recognition I draw something  can i recognize 
what you draw simple sketches not artistic you draw 
a car with 2 wheels box around itâ€™s body can I 
recognize is car this is where sketch recognition in 
deep nets works at some point overtooks human 
performance. Humans could not able to classify as 
accurate as deep net in that particular case it has 
11x11 filters. Then 5x5 and 3x3 and all. Inone 
particular case they have shown that seems to work 
well. Probably in sketch most of the places are just 
blank you only have lines once in a while initially 
they had a huge filter to capture at least some lines
in the filter. In general smaller size of filter can do 
better job than a larger number of filters. If i have 
budget of number of parameters that I have to fit 
in to my memory I would have rather gone with 
smaller number of filters and the number of layers.
