For blue points the condition is WTXi + b >= 1, the condition for red points is WTXi + b <= 1. 
If you multiply this with yi we get condition for both yi( WTXi + b)
Cont..
One way to do loss is we have a function called lagrange. The loss is going to be
½WTW - ∑𝛼i(yi( WTXi + b) - 1). 
Actual value is yi. Computed value is WTXi + b. The sign of this is going to be the output of the linear classifier.
If yi is different from WTXi + b , then the yi( WTXi + b) is 
negative.Then loss function will be more. If we have to minimize the signs of  yi and WTXi + b is the same.
