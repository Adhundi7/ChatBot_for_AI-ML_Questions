This is an inherent problem. In case of identical twins they share the same DNA as a single embryo is split into two and form into human beings. So, because genes are similar identical twins share the same facial features, this makes this a very difficult problem. Here, Random Forest may not be the best way as the information differentiating the two is distributed over the features, not just at a single feature where information is hidden (RF can pull from this feature). SVM may do a better  job at this. Mayde fingerprints are a better choice.
