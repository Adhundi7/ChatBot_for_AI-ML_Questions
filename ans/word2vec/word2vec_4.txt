For example “not” is a stop word. In general certain words are “not”, the stop for 
this might be different from stop words for document classification. So, you can 
even deal with this stop words. If you are dealing sufficiently large window you 
can include stop words also it doesn’t matter, it will capture enough context. The 
problem is if you want small window then stop words would become context, that 
would becomes a problem. Otherwise you can deal with stop words.
