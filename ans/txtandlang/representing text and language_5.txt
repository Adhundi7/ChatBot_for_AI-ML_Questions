If we can throw away the data and still the model can learn from new data, depends on the model. Some models are good for continuous or online learning where, as data comes in it keeps on learning. Second is that, the behaviour of the old data, whether you should keep it or not is itself a question. In some cases, you want to forget about the old data and move towards the new one. And again there is a question of how much you should forget, what you should forget, these are slightly more complex questions, we will talk about these at a later stage.
