Partially yes, we have that insights how it works we 
now know why it work is different we don't want to 
debug. we think that specific things work and after 
that we figured out we can do the last one which 
superseeds the remaining and we doesn't want to 
do the previous ones that worked well even we 
simplifyed also the things that works and doesn't 
work every thing is simple and intutive you think 
I could also have done this
we are still called top five only not top one 
because there is a ambiguity issues are there 
in the top five.
