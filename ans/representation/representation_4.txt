Trends that change over time I will leave it at this stage. Later stage we will talk about series of temporal data. Anything that is external, anything that you think makes sense add to x. You let  the machine learning algorithm to pick what is useful and what is not from the data rather than you using your intuition to decide. If the promotion you have done has to be captured, you add it to x. Maybe the money that you spent, the number of days of promotion that you did , in urban area or rural area, you add that in some form to x.
