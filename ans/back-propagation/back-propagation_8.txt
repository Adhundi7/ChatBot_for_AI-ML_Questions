What kind of a function can I select as a computational block is we need to know how to compute for each block that we are designing, we should know how to compute the dy by dx and dy by dw. So when you decide a computational block, you give it to the algorithm or implementations that this is my block; for this this is this derivative and his is this derivative. For the rest of it the code library can take care of it.
