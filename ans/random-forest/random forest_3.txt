This is a temptation for us. Why do we select random features, but with some intelligence. But this brings in bias. However this maybe a good thing to do, as we are looking at different parts of the feature set. With randomness there come some natural tendencies, a good feature will get selected each time it is in subset. We can do RF with many trials and pick the best subset of trees and combine them. Randomness is strong insurance policy against bias. Noise in data is also a good thing.
