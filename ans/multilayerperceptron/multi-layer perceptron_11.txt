It is not mandatory, but the way we will typically implement you remove some of
 this edges or some of this connections. You may not get much advantage in the
 memory these all are typically matrices.

It is much simpler to assume a simpler network and that is good enough.
 we are going to get anything out of it. So removing one edge is not going to 
give you two percentage extra performance or even point one percent extra 
performance. If you assume storage complexity of one byte or few bytes 
you are going to reduce here with this. It is very unlikely because you are storing 
things as a matrix and matrix with one element missing storing doesn’t give you
 any advantage, unless you remove lot of elements. So usually you don’t get 
by all these.  They are not going to give you anything extra. It is usually 
counter productive.
