In general multi-layered perceptron believes that every neuron in this layer is connected to every neuron in this. So, there are layers everything is fully connected. Computationally this also gives you a matrix type of multiplication. If this is not fully connected then you have lot of elements in the matrix as zero. It does not give typically any computational advantage. Usually, the multi layered perceptron always believes everything is fully connected.
