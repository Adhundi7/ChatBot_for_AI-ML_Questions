Suppose we have two dimensional feature space and we have 
a line that separates the more, we  move away from the line. 
we will get more and more positive values or more and more 
negative values. On top of it is What we will get is a function 
that looks like this in the space. It will be flat, almost flat zero 
here and then suddenly we will  jump up and then again one 
on the other side.
