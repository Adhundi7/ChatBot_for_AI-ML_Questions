You are saying network and deep learning as 
generic. The story of deep, deeper and deepest 
network works best with resnet after that people 
trigger out that it is not working well much after 
that people using resnet-t or 100 most then start 
tweaking other architectures we will see.

Architecture changes is not what you tweak here. 
What you do is you take problem which is similar
to yours if it is an image problem we look at the 
nearest image corresponding that other do take 
that as architecture and tweak those parameters 
that's the normal thing

Yes, image is also a regression problem the only 
difference between classification and regression 
is it got n number of labels and regression got 
continuous labels the output will be either 
1, 2, 3, 4â€¦ or the number between 1 to 4 for 
the network it is outputting somewhere between 
1 to 4  we push it to 1, 2, 3, 4 to force classification 
at the end obviously it is doing classification.
