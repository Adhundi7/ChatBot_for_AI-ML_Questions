Practically If we have a large sentence and we remove 
the stop words.Then pattern will not be same the way we listed.
For example you said “combated” will not occur in the same vector 
as with the “struggled”. So, “struggled” may occur at the 5th or 6th 
or may not be at the end of the sentence then how can we deal with this issue ?
