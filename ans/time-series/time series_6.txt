So first we need able to do predictions. First we need to come with a model and then we need to make a predictions.

The model can only tell the past. I have one year of data based on that I trained, but it has to be working on the future real data.

If all the predictions are going correctly, then that is not best. So predictions are not going to be correct. So the question is about  if you want to make predictions. So I think what you are talking about is a series of things after that which all remain exactly same. What I am only going to commit is at this moment this at look this is neural networks, mlp what we know as a machine learning algorithm is actually a nice competitor to anything that you use for prediction. Why because this is a very powerful non linear model. The model that we are going to see what you know the arma models, they are linear models and they are typically not trained with a whole data. In machine learning space what we do is usually, when you built such a model you keep data somewhere else and then train well and then test it. The classical modeling space which is from where this space from where this arma, arima style of things come. The way we do is one it is linear. Second, it is not built with the special learning way of model fitting.
