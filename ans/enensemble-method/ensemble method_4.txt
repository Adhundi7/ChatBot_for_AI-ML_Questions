That is why we are not going to do this kind of linear boundaries. At the end of it, what we are going to do is a weighted combination of the predictions. So each one predicts, this one predicts red on the other side and blue on the side with some probability, you do some probabilistic combination. And you'll end up getting a boundary which is not even linear, it could be non-linear.
