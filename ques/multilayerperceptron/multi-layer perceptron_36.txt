Can we say that when we are not able to decide based on
 the input data, what is an clear relationship between those 
that input data it will lead to the output, weather it is going 
to be linear, classification, regression or something.

we are not able to find the what kind of 
relationship from input data is used to generate one, 
two, three outputs. How do we deal  with this kind of 
problems.
