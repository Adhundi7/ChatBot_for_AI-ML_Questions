In y equals f(x), for a particular x t
here is a particular y the 
labelled data. In supply chain, 
when we take a truck there are 
environmental and other
factors that influence 
planning of the route. It could 
be optimized route because of 
cost, there may be lot of casual
factors that we see that may 
influence. In these equations, 
how will these factors effect?
