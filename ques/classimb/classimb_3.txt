One side we talk about our aim is to minimize the error 
on the other side if we do too much of that it will overfit. 
One side we say the number of features are as much as 
possible you should not have your own update on the 
other side it is ok to do on one side we say we don’t 
get much with the number of layers and the number 
of neurons being reduced or increased what all 
matters is changing the ‘w’ on other side we say 
it is ok to change. So the subject is like that we 
have to accept it see what is the right thing to do or
 in next few weeks we will get bit more clarity 
where are we?
