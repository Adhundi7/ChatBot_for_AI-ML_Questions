We are ignoring that. We are assuming that the speaker and the writer is the same for now.                                                      Cont..                                                                                      Same thing. We are trying to capture the style and the content of the speech assuming that based on the style and the content of the speech we can classify.
Cont..                                                                                          Probably both. In our particular problems, style is difficult to capture whereas content is easy to capture. So, we will stick with content as of now.
