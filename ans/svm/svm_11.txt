Not really. You can learn the kernel in some unsupervised way. Then, you can build a linear classifier using labelled data i.e supervised data which is a guaranteed best solution. We can combine these 
techniques and kernels is a way of doing that. We mentioned some kernels, but there could also be some kernels which are neural networks. This is called embedding technique which you will learn in 
further modules.
