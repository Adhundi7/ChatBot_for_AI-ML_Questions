That is the minimal assumption we are making. We can solve the problem with the data we have.

Words that are present in this document but not in others. So words like “iraq” may be unique to George Bush’s speeches as opposed to FDR or Kennedy. Two aspects that would come up. We will mathematically formulate after this.
