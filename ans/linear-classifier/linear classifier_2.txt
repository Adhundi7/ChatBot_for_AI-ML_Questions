Yes, we typically converts the non-linear problem into linear 
problem and solve it.

The idea behind kernels is,  suppose we have two set of samples 
were we can draw a curve to separate them, mathematically we 
can say that take the space and turn the space around so that
 separator become a line. If we know how to learn a line later on, 
we learned how to twist the space. That's what is called this fancy
 word called kernel. Basically it's just questing the space or 
warping the space.
