In this case, 3 corresponds to RGB yes.

Because in the layer I’m looking at the vertical lines. Vertical lines could be a combination of R, G and B if I’m looking for the brown line to grey line conversion there on the wall. Should I look at the R channel or B channel or G channel or a combination of three channels to figure that there is a line there?

Your filter has got 3X3X3 numbers and it will learn the numbers accordingly. It is in 3D.  So, you will have numbers in all the 27 cells inside this filter and those together it will decide that. So, if I’m looking for a transition from red to green then it will have the numbers appropriately.  If I’m looking for the transition from blue to yellow then it will have a different set of numbers, that’s possible. So, it depends on what you are looking at. So, remember that we are not gonna tell anything about this to the network.

Each feature will give you one channel. If I’m looking for the vertical line, that filter will fire. Let’s use the word called “firing”. I will put the filter at the particular position and if the output value is high, I call it the filter as fired. So, if I move the filter around, there are certain positions where it will fire, that means it has high values other places it will have low values Wherever this filter overlaps with the vertical line, it will have a high value, wherever it does not overlap with the vertical it will have a low value. So, if I do that for the whole image it will have some set of high values. Suppose, let's take an example, (figure on board) I have an image shape like this and if I have a filter that is looking for vertical lines. I convolve this filter with this image and whenever the filter comes to the position where this is a vertical line the output will fire, this will be the output, there will be high value here. At any other position, it will be low value. Over here also, it will be low value. So, you will see something like this. Something of this sort will be the output. If the filter was looking for the vertical lines, wherever there are vertical lines vertical over here, close to vertical you will see high outputs here, other places you will see low outputs. This is what I call as activation map or a channel, output channel. This is not related to red, green or blue, it so happens that input had red, green or blue channels. In general, a channel corresponds to a feature, not a color. What is a feature? A feature is whatever a feature detector detects, whatever a filter detects. So, this will fire for only these places. I have another filter which looks for horizontal lines. This if I run it across this, we will get another activation map that will have firing at some places here, other places it will be zero. I have another filter which looks for 45-degree lines that will fire in these positions. So, we are looking for like whenever I say features lowest level, I’m looking for the simplest features like this, a line like this. A step large value here, the small value here, it is called a step. A line is typically low high low. You can also have steps, you can also have a simple thing, plane regions, all kind of stuff. These are intuition examples which we are saying. We are not gonna tell the neural network, learn a vertical line here, learn a horizontal line here. No. We are only giving only 3 filters learn whatever you want. My overall goal is that these features should help me to classify whether it is a cat or a dog at the end of it and it will learn. After learning these things, we can actually peep into the neural network.
