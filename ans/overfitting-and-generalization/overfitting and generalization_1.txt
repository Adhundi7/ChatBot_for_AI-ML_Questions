So that true, if you have a complete knowledge of the data, you don’t require machine learning , you dont require AI, you just memorize every single possibility,you can hand code it. If you're worried about hand coding you can use this techniques instead of it for memorizing e.t.c.

As I said if let’s say I have a conveyor belt which I am just taking as a example. The conveyor belt which does some assembly, let say car assembly. I want to create a completely automated car assembly plant. I know every single component comes one of this is fitted on to some tray in which sample would be exactly the same position at the orientation. No need to do any learning. I can just teach a robot to go and angle. Your gripper like this, go down these many centimeters close it by so many. So much pressure come up. Do this things? It will work. If there is uncertainty in the data then machine learning is not suitable for this. There are two reasons for uncertainity: fundamentally you will not be able to create a system that is so perfect that every single sample is perfect, there will be noise in the data. This is the fundamental difference between the ML systems and traditional systems. Traditional systems remove this uncertainityin such a way that it will always come up in the same way.  Second is it might be cheaper to let some uncertainity through

The body doesn’t have to be exactly in the same way x coming on a conveyor belt. It will be roughly within couple of centimeters of where it is about.

Ya, we can avoid a whole bunch of this kind of uncertainity. Would exactly align the wheel in a certain way is one thing and second is, even if there is we have a physical mechanism to avoid this uncertainty.

It is trying to operate in presence of noise.

"It can. So that is one reason that there is noise. Noise is not necessarily bad. The world inherently contains noise. The questions is form a point of view as a system builder your asking the question do you want operate in the world there is no noise or your system should be more capable of and be able to operate in the regions where is some noise. That is the point. So if you ask a question would I require any of this? I work online or certainty yes, you don’t require.
Even there might be a reason why do want to use database because hand coding then learning that lookup table might be better mechanism than handcrafting the whole look up table. That is also possible. But even this why I am saying is the technique we are learning now has the ability to go over the regions where there is noise. This were idea of generalization comes in."
