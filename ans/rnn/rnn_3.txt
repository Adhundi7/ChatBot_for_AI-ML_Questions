The idea is since you are feeding the computer. For example, sending Wikipedia to it and Wikipedia has some structure in the sentences. That’s what we are hoping the network will learn. So, you say that ‘the bird was’ and then you know that the next word should be ‘flying’. In many times, in Wikipedia, if this happens most of the times. It just learns that. What we are hoping is that if we are allowing this, it learns the structure. Because that corpus has that structure. Previously, we are not allowed to exploit it. But now we allowed having a way to exploit it.
