No, If you know clearly what is a relation between input and output even you need 
a machine learning. To find a simple pendulum equation you donâ€™t need machine 
learning you can do that by using your physics knowledge. So,We will use this sort 
of technique when the system is so complex that we are not able to model. 
Beyond our science and physics understanding that is were this picture comes 
under.
