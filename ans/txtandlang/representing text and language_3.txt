We don’t usually keep the data. That’s the goal, we would ideally like to not keep the training data. After we learn we would like to keep only the model that we have learnt. We have some distilled information that is the model, so once i learn the model from the data, we don’t keep the data. There are some algorithms in which we still have to keep it. If it is nearest neighbor classifier, the data is the model. You store all the data and whenever a new sample comes in, you compare new sample with data, that is definitely the other extreme. But, ideally we would like to have something better than that.
