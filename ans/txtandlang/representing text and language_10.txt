I didn’t say that. I said don’t make an intermediate problem that is harder to solve than the final problem. 
Cont..                                                                                                                 This is a normal intuition, that we can take a problem and divide into smaller pieces and solve the smaller pieces and combine them. This is what we know and this is true. I am not saying that this is not true. The problem is in machine learning you are solving a problem by learning . What we do, when we break the problem into smaller problems, the problem is “we” in there. The machine is supposed to solve the problem and we are trying to break the problem into smaller problems, we try to break it such that the smaller problems are easier for us to solve.                                                                                                Cont..                                                                                                                   Not necessarily, let the machine divide. Let us not divide. Because, when we divide, we think of smaller problems that we can solve, but may not be easy for machine to solve. Many time it so happens that the smaller problems are more difficult for the machine to solve, than solving the final problem.
