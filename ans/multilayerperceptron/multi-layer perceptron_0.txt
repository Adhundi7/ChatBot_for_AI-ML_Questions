The both input size and output size is given to you.In between we have 
three layers. The first one is slightly larger, the second is more slightly 
larger and then reduce. So it is this level of induced is quite good enough. 
I am saying beyond that the worry I don't know  is not required because 
whatever the number that you pick twenty five instead of twenty three that 
is not good change because Neural Networks are over parameterized means
 that there are lot of extra neurons If you remove this the performance is 
not decreases but the training becomes easier. But at the same time 
there is a chance of over fitting, that is the reason you will not include
 more and more extra neurons.
