Let’s use the word correctly 3 more layers or 4 more “channels” or 3 more filters or 4 more filters.

 (Figure is a 3X3 filter drawn on the diagram) So, the first one might be a.. Let’s take the example of image case what Asokan was talking before. Suppose, I have a 3X3 filter when I say the center pixel where I would put the filter at and the rest of it would be multiplied around it. So, I’m looking for a vertical line in the image equivalent of a “ka” in the image is a vertical line. A vertical line means if I see that the vertical line passes through this pixel that means that the line should be present here and here. But not present here and here. So, if it a black line that I’m looking for in a white background then your filter would look something like this. It will be zeros over here and ones over here. This will be the nature of the filter. I’m not saying that I’m gonna write this down. This is what it will end up learning. I’m not even going to tell them that learn a vertical line, that also it will figure out. All I’m going to do is you have the flexibility to learn a 3X3 filter I give you that many parameters. I’m telling that to the network. I give this to the network, let it figure out what values should it put so that it will extract the feature it will be useful for the classification

Yes, we will look at these now.
