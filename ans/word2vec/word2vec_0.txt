Surrounding words in the same tuples. 
These are consecutive words, 
when I take a tuple it is created out of consecutive words.

For example consider two words “combated” and “struggled” from 
two different sentences. Now, I want to understand that two words 
meaning is same and if they are in the exactly same 
neighborhood as other words around then I can say that in these 
sentences the words combated and struggled occurs. The 
neighboring words are exactly in same hence they should be 
same.
