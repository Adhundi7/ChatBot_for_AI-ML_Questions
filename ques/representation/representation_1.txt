If we have supervised model
and the data if we have 
symptoms we know the 
diagnosis. We know the 
predicted output.we have 
patients records which differ 
from the actual symptoms 
records. We have both 
supervised and unsupervised
data. In this which one has to
be taken as training data and
how to segregate the data?
