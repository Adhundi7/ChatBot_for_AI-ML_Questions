We don’t know. The only thing we can say is that we have some kind of data available. In most practical situations, what we have is what we have. We don’t have more information than that available. The only thing we can do is not to throw more information from that. Detain as much as possible. Do we know whether this is not good enough, at the end of it if the machine learning algorithm is not performing well, apparently it is not good enough.   Cont..                                                                                                                                         We will talk about that aspect. We may not talk about how to create the best data possible, we will be teaching you that we cannot create the best data.
