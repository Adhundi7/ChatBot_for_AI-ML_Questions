Yes, for simple image recognition task 
you can use but if I have large image 
and i want to recognize multiple objects 
that is a problem first we need to detect 
where the objects are and for each 
individual object we do a recognition 
and the recognition part what we are 
talking about typically there is a detection
followed by recognition it allows you 
to do multiple detections and for that 
you have to do recognition
