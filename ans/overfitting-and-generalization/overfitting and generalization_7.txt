It is beginning of memorizing.Your beginning to memorize at this point. The more and more we overfit that much memorizing your doing.

I think I should clarify a bit. If chaitanya and narayana were telling you more and more data about all the problems in the world. Yes it will unlikely overfit. The problem is that they are trying to give you more and more data on a trailer test. There is a pattern to the test that’s the problem.so in general that is true what your saying.The more amount of the data you have less overfitting. The problem which coaching institute is that because the diversity of the test is actually pretty simple. They have figured out sufficient number of. I mean figure out test will appear will have questions of this pattern only. That’s it. Okay. so in that sense the children overfit for the test. The test generalization purpose is very good. The problem is that they need to work in real life after that. When you come to real life, when you come to professional institution where you are asked to given a small circuit, you know tell them figure out what the problem is this is not working well. He will ask give options a,b,c,d I will tell you what to do. So that is not how world works. So the problem is that you like what you also mentioned before that your real life has doesn’t get much diversity. In case of entrance exam the real life was exam that has only certain patterns. This will overfit.But, there is a possibility of doing it.
