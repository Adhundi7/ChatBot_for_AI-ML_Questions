There are two types of multi-class classifications. One is that classes data is disjoint, other is that they are intersecting. When classes are intersecting we can still use this. 
Suppose two classes are mammal and human. We have separate linear classifiers for mammal and human. Train separate classifier for each class. Itâ€™s not a combined training 
like your MLP
