It has been used multiple times during training but 
when the data is playing the role of the test data,
 that model that was trained didn’t see that we have 
a problem of memory. Because it is a machine if I 
randomly initialize all the samples it will forget 
everything. With human being this is difficult you 
can’t do this because you can’t perfectly forget. 
Here I will take a model and initialize the samples
 randomly it is a fresh slate. So everytime it is a
 fresh algorithm it will start from scratch but still 
It might be overfitting during the training process.
