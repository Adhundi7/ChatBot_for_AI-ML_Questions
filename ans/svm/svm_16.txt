Human and mammal could be overlapping classes. Since you are training separate classifiers it wonâ€™t be a problem.

Each datapoint has two class labels y1 whether first class is present or not, y2 whether second class is present or not. Each datapoint has 4 possibilities: none of two classes, 
first class, second class, or both the classes. With respect to each of these labels we can train a separate classifier and looking at the output of classifier we can tell if that class is 
present or not. If both the classes are present both the classifiers output to 1.
