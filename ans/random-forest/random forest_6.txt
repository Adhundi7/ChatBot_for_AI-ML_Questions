Popular way is voting. In a weak decision tress, when you arrive at a node it will not be completely pur, 80% one class and 10% second and 10% third. So votinng is done 0.8 strength for first, 0.1 for second and 0.1 for third. So all trees vote for each class and then aggregate and find which class has the most weight. Decision tree can only give simple boundary, but with random forest we get complex boundaries. RF also does not overfit.
