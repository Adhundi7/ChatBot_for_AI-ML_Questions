After learning the model some part of the Neural Networks is not active becuase 
weights are small. you got a network in this case of matrix 4 * 4, assume the 
elements in this matrix are small, you make all them zero and perform matrix multiplication
you will get almost same output here. so we can remove some of neurons not  performed
bad, effecting from a small set of weights  is a bad choice. To conncet with human
brain, if you brain has redudant neurons to learn faster which we all have. redudant neuron
that is why when some neurons get damaged, the neurons can take over and adjust the weights 
little bit and still continue to the same task with the same performance. when the damage becomes more 
critical then we cann't perform anything.
