No, We perform feature reduction, this is the opposite 
of dimension reduction. Actually we are doing 
dimensionality exposure. So we can reduce its right 
the hope in that thing, the two dimension things were 
not nicely separable. For example, if you have a set of 
data which is not linearly separable but xy cartesian 
correlate. So if you are able to transform the problem 
which is not very nice like a linearly separable, from on
e feature space to the other will become a linearly 
separable in this case.
