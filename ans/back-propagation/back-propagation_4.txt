No there is no global minima. Remember I can search only weights in this range, I don’t know what happens after the weight. So, the global minima problem is I can search assume you use brute force technique to search the weights. I can search from weights running one to twenty but I don’t know the weight if it cross two billion. I don’t have a way to search from one to two billion by using brute force technique but I have a way to search from zero to two billion on every axis with infinite high precision. So, such that of goal we are unable to do because we have we don’t know global minima.
