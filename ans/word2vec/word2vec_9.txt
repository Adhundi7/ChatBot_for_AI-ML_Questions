It’s possible. These directions are approximate. So, when I say vector for queen is 
equal to vector of king from vector of man and woman. It’s never perfect, what 
you will do is take vector of king subtract from vector of man and add it to vector 
of woman then you will get the vector and you will ask the question what is the 
closest vector to that in the dictionary because these are the real numbers you 
will never get the exact.
