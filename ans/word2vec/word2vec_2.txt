Here there are two issues: one is how come all sentences are five consecutive 
words. So, typically you do is remove the stop words and take five consecutive 
words weather they actually formed as a sentence or not is not a problem. But 
you take a large amount of text, remove all the stop words and take consecutive 
five words. If a particular word occurs in a particular context like “I walk through 
the road”, “I walk through the lay” in these the sentences may be occured at two 
different places at two different documents but since I have sentences that look 
like road, lay all are similar things.
