It is not overfitting in this case but it is more because 
you have bias sampling of your data. The  dataset is 
not indicative of the real world data if that is not the
 case what you said would happen because of 2 reasons
 one is when you have bias sampling of your data, 
where you have one kind of data and real world has
 other kind of data. Second might be your test set is 
too small that you can get is artificially low or high
 number because the size of test is too small. If it
 performs well on test data it should perform well 
on real world data if you have proper sampling it should.
