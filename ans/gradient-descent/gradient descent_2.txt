Yes and No. If we have a quadratic function, the easiest one is 
take the second derivative to zero directly, we can solve for it and 
there are many solutions of that nature. Many times it is difficult 
to find the second derivative that could be one reason. 
So, gradient descent is very generic procedure. It will be applied 
to whole bunch of stuff. First derivatives are usually easier to
 find whereas second derivatives used to find the bases local 
of that. But that will not be the local of the real function will
 be local of an approximate parabola fit over there.
