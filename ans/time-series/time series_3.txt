MLP will give w. Your worry here is the assumption you made regarding the structure of NN, but the other way to look at this is assume you are given a 100 inputs the NN can throw away lot of these neurons saying that this is not affecting. You are proposing a NN and then asking the NN to see if they dont fit and remove some of the neurons by making them zero. My only requirement is on the data given to me the predictions should be good.

Yes, we made a small assumption here that it depends on previous ten or twenty five or something. So, this is a typical make a assumption that we make everywhere. If you want that to be also found by neural network it is a much larger computational or parameter set. People also say you can put a another for loop outside and put where input neurons changed from one to hundred repeat this. If your architecture is more complex than what is required a neural network has a capability of making the way to throwing the inputs.
