Essentially, if you are asking the question should I accept the return or not? In this particular case, there are three classes. One is yes I should accept. Second, no I should not accept. The third is I don’t know. So, ‘I don’t know’ is should actually go through here. In this particular example, I gave you is so happens that it never takes the ‘no’ decision. Rejections, for example, credit cards. You never reject a credit card through a machine learning system because of the explainability that we talked about it before. If I want to reject the credit card, I should give an explanation first of why it happened. ‘I don’t know’ is processed through a human being. ‘Yes’ is directly processed.
