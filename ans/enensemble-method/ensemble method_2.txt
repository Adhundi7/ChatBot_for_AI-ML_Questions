So strong classifier combination is also something that has been studied well. But the only interesting point I wanted to mention that if I combine multiple strong classifiers, you will get slightly better classifier, but weak tends to go farther than what you normally think. Like strong classifier, a few of them in the higher eighties will combine to get something in the lower nineties. But weak classifiers go from the sixties will go beyond ninety which is not something that you would normally expect. Ok? So why is it as a side note? There is a bit of theory that we need to get into her strong biases and how they train to combine. It is not true that any set of weak classifiers will do this. They cannot be too biased, but their variances can be high.
