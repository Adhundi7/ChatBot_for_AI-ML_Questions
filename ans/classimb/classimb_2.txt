Our goal is to estimate error rate. I want to know
 what is the performance of the model. In this case
 I have somehow figured out the parameters like no 
of layers and neurons and these are fixed. Now I 
have to figure out if I train this how well this will do. 
By doing multiple rounds of training and testing and
 taking average over them removing the risk of
 particularly having them hard for my test data. 
If you do training there is still an internal overfit
 that is still there.
