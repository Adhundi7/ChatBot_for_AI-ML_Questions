We learnt two linear algorithms i.e perceptron and SVM.Perceptron does not give maximum margin. Firstly, SVM gives maximum margin. Secondly, we can avoid higher dimensions using kernels. These 
things we won’t be able to do with linear classifiers. Learn a kernel using MLP and then use this kernel for linear classification. Finding similarity between points might be using a neural network, then use 
this similarity function to compute a linear classifier. In SVM you have a guarantee of getting a optimal solution, but in MLP you don’t have a guarantee of getting a optimal solution.
