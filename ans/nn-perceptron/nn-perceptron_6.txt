We realize things are not accurate enough, so with complex model we can ensure that. By increasing we are losing, so with orginal raw data which was in 10000 we want to reduce it by removing a lot of irrelevant ones. Later, we will map the 10000 dimension representation to infinite dimension and get good results. Not increase or decrease, our objective is to get good results. To get good results, whatever is the trick let's take it.
