That is the next problem. Right now we are talking about input raw data, the feature representation and the machine learning problem where you map from the input to the output. We learn about mapping from input to output when we learn about the labels. Right now we are talking about the raw data.                                          Cont..                                                                                                                                                                        That is slightly different. The difference is synonyms or stuff like that. Different kinds of verbs, present tense, past tense like that. We will discuss that a bit later. Right now, there is dumb representation, each one is a different word. So, “like” and “love” are two different words. As different as “like” and “hate”, “love” and “hate”. In 1-hot representation, the meaning of the word is completely lost. We are only saying this word is present here and this word is not present here. The fact that they are very similar words doesn’t help. That’s one of the problems with 1-hot representation.
