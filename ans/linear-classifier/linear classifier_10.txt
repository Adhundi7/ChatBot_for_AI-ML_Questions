The line that could be separates red and blue is the classification 
problem. There is a regression problem where there are a 
bunch of points are given and we are supposed to learn a 
line that passes through all the points thatâ€™s very related to 
machine learning problems. Some of the real world problems, 
when we try to map it into machine learning problem 
or it into regression problem and there our yi would be the 
output and our xi would be the input. So basically our input 
and output pair which we want to approximate a line. 
Whatever we are discussing will be applied to both. 
So it doesn't fit very well to classification the way we are
 discussing the reason is primarily this one.
