The correct classification means loss equal to zero. Then the loss 
for all the three lines used to classify the data becomes zero. 
So we canâ€™t even be able to differentiate between all three lines
 and that is precisely the problem with a simple gradient based 
algorithms.SVM will have a different loss function in which will 
not be satisfied. Just by correctly classifying it has to still push
 to get to the black and that is not a trivial thing to do.
