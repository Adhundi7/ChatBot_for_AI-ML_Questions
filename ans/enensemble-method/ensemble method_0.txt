The common thing to do here is if there N samples in original data then you pick N samples. This is sampling with replacement. Suppose there are 100 samples in original data, we take all 100 samples

No. 2 class problem, with 100 samples. I have a basket with 2 colored balls red and blue. I want to sample hundred times from it, but every time a sample I note down the feature vector of the ball and put it back. Mix it, randomly would blindly pick another ball, look at itâ€™s details and put it back into the mix, do this hundred times. You would expect that some of the samples might actually come back when I resample

They are all linear classifiers but trained on multiple samplings.So first I do a hundred samples, I get a set on, which will I train a classifier, then I will repeat the process again to the hundred samples, each time you will get a slightly different classifier
