In practice, we are still in the land between completely hand coded and to moving towards learning. Initial hand coding stages, people look at the features and decide these are not important and remove it.    One intuition could be that the words that occur multiple times are more important. That’s not the only reason why it is more important. If we use a word again and again then that is a part of the theme or speech. It is more important to understand it. But if we are repeating the word ”the”, the fact that we are repeating the word doesn’t help it. That’s why those are stop words.
